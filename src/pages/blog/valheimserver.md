*Editors Note: The pictures used are from a test run I did, so the IP address and other normally sensitive information aren't hidden, as this build has been decommissioned.*

For my first project I wanted to learn more about Virtual Machines and running servers on them in Azure. To do this I choose to set-up a Valheim server running on a Linux VM.

First I needed to set up a ssh key pair for securely accessing my VM, I did this by opening up Cloud Shell and running the following command

```
    ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096

```

I then accessed the public key, via a cat view command

```
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

```

Then I it copied, to add during the creation of the VM.

I then created a virtual machine through the Azure portal, I chose a Standard B2s (2 vcpus, 4 GiB memory), as this is the recommended size for a Valheim server. I didn't create any additional discs as the storage that comes with the VM is more than enough to host the files needed.

Once it was deployed I accessed the VM via SSH, verifying with the key pair that I previously set-up. The first thing I did was create root access, this is necessary for completing a lot of tasks within the environment, and in our case it's needed to create a new user and edit some files.

        sudo passwd root

Then I installed all of the depancies the server required to run.

```
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386; sudo apt update; sudo apt install curl wget file tar bzip2 gzip unzip bsdmainutils python util-linux ca certificates binutils bc jq tmux netcat lib32gcc1 lib32stdc++6 libsdl2-2.0-0:i386 steamcmd

```

Once that was complete I created a new user for the server, with a simpler name for quicker use and access.

        adduser vhserver

![](/images/new%20user.png)

I then signed into that new user and downloaded the server manager, I went with LinuxGSM, as it is a very popular platform with an active community.

        wget -O linuxgsm.sh https://linuxgsm.sh && chmod +x linuxgsm.sh && bash linuxgsm.sh vhserver

![](/images/installed%20linuxgsm.png)

Once this was done I used it to install the Valheim server components

```
    ./vhserver install


```

After the install I then had to configure the server before running it, this meant navigating to the config files

```
    cd /home/vhserver/lgsm/config-lgsm/vhserver

```

I then removed the common.cfg file

```
    rm common.cfg

```

and replaced it with a copy of the default.cfg

```
    cp _default.cfg common.cfg

```

![](/images/edit%20config%201.png)
Next I accessed the newly created common.cfg with the vim command

```
    vim common.cfg

```

and proceeded to edit the servers name and add a password for better security.

I saved my changes and navigated back to the root and then booted up the server

        ./vhserver start

![](/images/VH%20server%20start.png)

I then ran a quick check to see if the server was up and running.

        ./vhserver details

![](/images/VH%20server%20stats.png)

It was then time to jump back over to the Azure Portal to forward the required ports, so that the server could be accessed from outside its virtual network.

This is as simple as adding a new allow access inbound rule to the ports between 2456-2457.

After this I navigated to the IP settings for my VM and set the Ip to Static, this means that the VM IP will stay the same between shutdowns. This is important for me as this is the way Iâ€™d be accessing the server.

With all of this done my server was now up and accessible, and my friends and I would be able to play on it whenever we wanted. I learned a decent amount from this project; such as how to create users in Linux, how to download files in Linux, and how to navigate and edit files.
